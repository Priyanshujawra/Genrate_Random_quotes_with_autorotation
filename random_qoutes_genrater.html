    let text_content = `Believe you can, and you're halfway there.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does, Keep going.
Success is not the key to happiness, Happiness is the key to success.
The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
Believe in yourself, take on your challenges, dig deep within yourself to conquer fears, Never let anyone bring you down, You got this.
The only person you should try to be better than is the person you were yesterday.
Your time is now, Start where you stand and never back down.
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
Dream big and dare to fail.
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind, Be led by the dreams in your heart.
If you can dream it, you can achieve it.
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.
Believe in yourself and all that you are, Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.
Success is not the absence of failure; it's the persistence through failure.
Success comes to those who work for it.
The only limit is the one you set yourself.
Your dreams are within reach if you are willing to work for them.
The journey may be difficult, but the destination is worth it.
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
The only way to predict the future is to create it.
Your attitude determines your direction.
Don't wait for opportunity, create it.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
The only failure is the failure to try.
Strive for progress, not perfection.
The best time to start is now.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
You are stronger than you think.`;
